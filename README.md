# AIA_Need4Stek_2020
Autonomous car concept - C artificial intelligence

### How to use Need4Stek :

1. **Installation**

Download CoppeliaSim Edu V4.0.0(the assets provided for the project function solely with Linux and Mac).


2. **Scene**

Before beginning simulations, you must systematically open a scene. To open a scene, go to `File` > `Open scene...` and import one of the scenes (`.ttt`) located in the `scene/` folder at the root of the repository. Each scene represents a racetrack.

3. **Run the simulation**

Run this command from the root of the repository to start the simulation:
```
./pipes.sh
```

To see the car making its way through the racetrack using our artificial intelligence, go back to the CoppeliaSim window.
